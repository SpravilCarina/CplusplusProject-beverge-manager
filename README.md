Project Overview:
The Beverage Maker project is a C++ application designed to simulate a beverage selection and preparation system. It allows users to select various beverages, simulating a real-world scenario of beverage-making. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles and user interaction through a command-line interface.
Key Features:
Beverage Selection:
Users can choose from a predefined list of beverages, including coffee, tea, juice, and more.
Each beverage has unique properties and preparation requirements.
Simulation of Beverage Preparation:
The program simulates the preparation process of selected beverages, including steps such as brewing, mixing, and serving.
The simulation includes realistic scenarios such as ingredient availability and preparation time.
Object-Oriented Design:
Classes and Inheritance: Implemented classes for different types of beverages with inheritance to handle common properties and methods.
Operator Overloading: Utilized operator overloading for beverage comparison and display operations.
Encapsulation: Encapsulated beverage details and preparation logic within classes.
User Interaction:
Command-line interface for users to interact with the system, select beverages, and view preparation results.
Input validation and error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.
How to Run:
Compile the Code:
Use a C++ compiler to compile the source files. Example command: g++ -o beverage_maker main.cpp Beverage.cpp.
Execute the Program
Run the compiled executable. Example command: ./beverage_maker.
Interact with the Program:
Follow the on-screen prompts to select beverages and simulate the preparation process.
Dependencies:
C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
Standard C++ Library
